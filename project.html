        The overarching goal of the RDL project is to improve the quality and effectiveness of the worldâ€™s risk information by making the underlying data easier to work with. The immediate focus is the data needs of risk assessment, with the knowledge that the solutions we develop here will be valuable to many members of the DRM community.

        The Risk Data Library concept emerged from in-depth research into the risk information needs and priorities of the DRM sector. In 2014, GFDRR and DfID launched an 18-month consultation with donors, data producers and users from over a hundred organisations across the DRM community. Several priority needs were identified and seed funding made available to projects that would start to address them.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-padding-bottom">
        The Risk Data Library began as one of these projects and addresses four of the eight priorities identified in the research:
        - Plausible hazard scenarios for developing countries
        - Open and freely available vulnerability functions
        - Exposure datasets suitable for detailed risk assessment
        - An established standard for model interoperability
