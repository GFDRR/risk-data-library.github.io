title: The RDL Database
description: The library database has been designed to overcome a recurrent issue with risk data: different datatypes then to be stored separately. Risk experts must access multiple sources to gather the datasets they need, even when those datasets have the same origin.

      Purpose-built for storing risk datasets, the library database has several advantages for the DRM sector.

        Storing all data types in a single environment
      </p>
      <p>
        Database holds hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss data in the same environment. Risk data generated by projects no longer need to be separated. Less effort for project teams and less overhead for organisations storing data.

        Single search
      </p>
      <p>
        Being stored in the same environment means all dataset in the library database can be accessed with a single search, regardless of data type. Locating hazard, exposure, vulnerability or modelled loss data—particularly when produced by the same project—will not require risk experts to perform multiple searches across different resources.

        Static links for easier
      </p>
      <p>
        Each dataset stored in the library database is assigned its own unique URL. Sharing a specific dataset is simple as sharing the link. Recipients taken directly to dataset’s individual page with all metadata clearly displayed. Datasets to be reliably bookmarked for later reference or access. Users in areas of low internet connectivity can take advantage of this to ‘shortlist’ datasets for later download.

        API access and a network of databases
      </p>
      <p>
        Robust API access is built into the Library database. Data stored in the library database can be referenced and accessed by other authorised resources. And when combined with the single-search functionality, this feature lays the foundation for a network of connected library databases—all accessible via one search interface— which would significantly reduce the time and complexity of locating risk data.
